Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.",

The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to over 227 million and we are working towards including a reference proteome for each taxonomic group. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to update or create reviewed entries, while unreviewed entries are supplemented with annotations provided by automated systems using a variety of machine-learning techniques. In addition, the scientific community continues their contributions of publications and annotations to UniProt entries of their interest. Finally, we describe our new website (https://www.uniprot.org/), designed to enhance our users’ experience and make our data easily accessible to the research community. This interface includes access to AlphaFold structures for more than 85\\% of all entries as well as improved visualisations for subcellular localisation of proteins.}",

    abstract = "{The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org) is a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and gene products (proteins and noncoding RNAs). GO annotations cover genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses, though most gene function knowledge currently derives from experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model organisms. Here, we provide an updated overview of the GO knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates the GO knowledgebase. The GO knowledgebase consists of three components: (1) the GO—a computational knowledge structure describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) GO annotations—evidence-supported statements asserting that a specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic; and (3) GO Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs)—mechanistic models of molecular “pathways” (GO biological processes) created by linking multiple GO annotations using defined relations. Each of these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA checks, reviews, and user feedback. For each of these components, we provide a description of the current contents, recent developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the data that we provide. We conclude with future directions for the project.}",

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a tool used to identify the evolutionary relationships and common patterns between genes. Precisely it refers to the sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences, usually DNA, RNA or protein. Alignments are generated and analysed with computational algorithms. Dynamic and heuristic approaches are used in most MSA algorithms. One of the objectives of MSA is to detect structural or functional similarities between proteins in the comparison of another protein sequence. MSAs require advanced approaches rather than parallel alignment because the computational complexity is greater. More than global optimisation, most MSA programmes use heuristic approaches. However, the key issues in MSA will be to uphold the expanding quantities of data set and deal efficiently with nucleic acid alignments. This chapter will cover a variety of sequence alignment types and methods.}
